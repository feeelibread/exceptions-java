# exceptions-java
Well, to be honest i'm just learning java and that exercise is just an exercise about exceptions (try, catch and finally). 
So that's the first exercise that I made (with a help of a course obviously).
Feel free to help me if you want to.

# update warning
I'm gonna update here while i'm progreding.
